# Run .travis.yml Github Action

[![CI Status][badge.svg]](https://github.com/ktomk/run-travis-yml/actions)

For the [pipelines project][p] there was need to migrate from travis-ci.org
to travis-ci.com (as travis-ci.org is shutting down).

> **Pro-Tip:** Do not migrate from travis-ci.org to travis-ci.com, but
> look for other migration options first.

Turned out it is good to have some more options to execute the `.travis.yml`
based build script as well on Github via Github Actions.

Extracting parts of the open-source interface of Travis-CI from
[`travis-build`][TRAVIS-BUILD] as a *Github Action* to make the
`.travis.yml` more portable to Github w/o changing everything at once
and a smoother migration.

## Example

This projects [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml) [running as Github Action][example-run]:

## Usage

[Inputs](#inputs)
| [Outputs](#outputs)
| [Environment](#environment)

```yaml
  - name: Run .travis.yml build script
    uses: ktomk/run-travis-yml@v1
    with:
      file: .travis.yml
      stages: |
        install
        script
      allow_failure: false
    env:
      TRAVIS_PHP_VERSION: ${{ matrix.php-versions }}
```

### Inputs
* `file` (optional) Path to `.travis.yml` file (`.travis.yml` by default ).
* `stages` (optional) Stages to run as a space separated list (by default
  the following stages/steps are run: `setup`, `before_install`, `install`,
  `before_script`, `script`, `after_script`, `before_deploy`).
* `allow_failure` (optional) Allow failure set to `true` allows build
  failures and to `false` to actually fail, which is the normal behaviour.
  This failure behaviour can also be controlled by the
  `TRAVIS_ALLOW_FAILURE` environment variable, the input overrides the
  environment variable when set. Double check cache and artifacts
  configuration for side effects and see `outputs.test_result` and
  `outputs.outcome`.

### Outputs
* `test_result` Outcome of `TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT`, either `0` if all commands
   in the `script` section have exited with zero or `1` otherwise.
* `conclusion` The result of the .travis.yml build after `allow_failure`
  / `TRAVIS_ALLOW_FAILURE` is applied. Possible values are `success` or
  `failure`.
* `outcome` The result of the .travis.yml build before `allow_failure`
  / `TRAVIS_ALLOW_FAILURE` is applied. Possible values are `success` or
  `failure`.

### Environment
`TRAVIS_*` environment variables are created by the action for a good start.
These defaults can always be overridden with the typical steps `env:` key,
missing ones can be added (The runner does not infer the programming
languages' versions so the according `TRAVIS_*_VERSION` need to be set).

At the beginning of the action run, the current state of the `TRAVIS_*`
environment is shown for convenience. It also makes the given [defaults
visible][example-env]:

[![Travis Environment of a .travis.yml run in a Github Action](.github/assets/env-travis-yml.png)][example-env]

Currently, three environment variables are exported, so they are available
for further job steps:

* `TRAVIS_ALLOW_FAILURE` - see `inputs.allow_failure`, `outputs.test_result`
* `TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT` - see `outputs.test_result`
* `TRAVIS_YAML_FILE` - see `inputs.file`

This also allows to run the same file multiple times, e.g. different
stages step-by-step.

## Notes
* Lightweight port to support migrating travis-ci build scripts, your
  mileage may vary.
* Running the stage(s) as build script based on the original
  [`travis-build`][TRAVIS-BUILD].
* Custom stages only (no matrix, deployment, after_success etc.), this needs
  additional matrix/actions in your workflow (checkout, VM setup, services,
  caching). Helps to do an actual migration, e.g. reducing matrix on Travis
  first to get build minutes down, the matrix on Github is not affected by
  that.
* Folding supported, Github just has no such nice labels thought.
* Similar on Github the timing information is not as nice as the
  one on Travis-CI.
* First error in script is annotated. If `TRAVIS_ALLOW_FAILURE` is `true`
  the annotation is a warning, not an error. Further, following output
  is folded to keep it better visible within the Github log viewer.
* Github has no allow-failure option when running action job steps. Lukily
  The ***Run .travis.yml Github Action*** has `TRAVIS_ALLOW_FAILURE`, see
  `inputs.allow_failure` as well.
